## Video 1
+ Bill Gates doing his thing

## Video 2
+ 4 things that make a computer a computer
    1. Input
    1. Storage
    1. Processing
    1. Output

## Video 3
+ A 'bit' is the smallest amount of information a computer can store (this 'yes' or 'no'). If you have just a single wire running through the computer, it can be 'on' or 'off.' That would be a 'bit.'
+ Bits or wires are the building blocks for computers, which rely on a Binary number system to assign values to numbers, text, images, videos, graphics, and so on.

## Video 4
+ Circuits are SO COOL!! They're made up of hundreds of bits which allows us to do all of the calculatoins computers rely on to operate etc.

## Video 5
+ Memory and CPU work together to store and process the input so you can get the desired output - your computer has MANY cpu's and a lot of Memory to run all the complex tasks you ask of it.

## Video 6
+ Hardware is hardware and software is software. 
+ Operating Systems help dictate how the software runs?
