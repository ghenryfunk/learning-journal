## Learning Markdown
1. Use ** on either side of your text to make it bold
  - ex. **this should appear as bold text**
2. Use a single * on either side of your text to make it italicized
 - ex. *this should be italicized*
3. You can set up a hyperlink by placing the text within brackets [] and immediately following with the URL wrapped in regular parentheses ().
 - ex. [This sentence should be a hyperlink to CodeFellows website](https://www.codefellows.org/).
4. To create check boxes, use brackets w/ a space in bewteen opening and closing bracket.
 - [ ] Checkbox #1
 - [x] Checkbox #2 (this one should be checked because I typed an 'x' in it!)
 - [ ] Checkbox #3
 - [ ] Checkbox #4 (it took me 4 checkboxes to figure out I could no longer type 'ex.' before the bracket... ugh... GROWTH MINDSET!)
5. To mention a person or team on Github, use the @ symbol befor the person's name
 - ex. @RyanGallaway am I doing this right?... I fear not. But I will learn from my failures!
