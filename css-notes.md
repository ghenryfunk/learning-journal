# Chapter 10 Introducing CSS
    - There is an invisible box around every HTML element
        - CSS allows you to create rules that control the way each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented
        
    -CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
        - CSS rules contain two parts:
            1. Selector
            2. Declaration (inside {brackets})
            
        - Declarations are made up to two pars:
            1. Property {like font-family or color}
            2. Value {like Arial or yellow}
                ex. h1 {font-family: Arial;}

    - If you want to include CSS rules WITHIN the HTML page, you can do so by placing them within a <style> bracket. BUT this is generally only done on very small specific sinlge web pages

    - There are many different types of CSS selector that allos you to target rules to specific elementi in an HTML document (SEE PAGE 238)

    -Note - if there are multiple CSS rules, learn how one will take precedent over the other (pg. 239)
