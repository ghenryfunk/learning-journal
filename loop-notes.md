# Read 08 Operators and Loops

- **Comparison Operators**
    - Is equal to ==
    - Is not equal to !=
    - Strict equal to ===
    - Strict not equal to !==
    - Greater than >
    - Less than <
    - Greater than or equal to >=
    - Less than or equal to <=

- **Logical Operators**
    - Logical and &&
    - Logical or ||
    - Logical not !

- **Loops**
    - Three common types of loops:
        1. For - used to run code for a specific number of times
        1. While - used to run code for any number of times - will run until condition is no longer coming back as 'true'
        1. Do while - very similar to the 'while' loop but with one key difference - will run statements inside the curly brackets {} at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false

        - Loops have a condition, which is made up of statements like:
            - var i = 0; (sets the variable equal to 0)
            - i < 10; (tells the loop to stop running once variable is no longer less than 10)
            - i++ (one is added to the counter using this 'increment operator')
